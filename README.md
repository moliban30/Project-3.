# Project-3.
This code generates a random name by selecting a color and animal name from two predefined lists (colors and animals) by asking the user to input two numbers between 0 and 5. 
The two numbers represent the indices of the color and animal name in the respective lists. 
The function returns the concatenated string of the selected color and animal names with a space in between. 
The main part of the code runs manual and automated tests on the generateName function and prints out the results of the tests.
